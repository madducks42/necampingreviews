        <br>
        <br>
        <p>We're both long-time tent campers.  But, a while back, I realized
        that more <em>convenience</em> and <em>comfort</em> means we can take
        more trips...</p>
        <br>

        <p>I started with a little <a
        href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/AlinerOutside.jpg">Aliner hard-sided
        pop-up</a>.   It was just big enough for James (3 or 4 years old at the
        time) and myself. The key was that I could pack it up in advance... in
        fact I'd leave most of our gear in the camper... come home from work on
        a Friday, and take off for a weekend of camping. It also had <a
        href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/AlinerInside.jpg">a little 3-way
        fridge (and sink and stove)</a>, which meant I could also pack the food
        up the night before. Add in a "real" bed, and its clear why we barely
        used our tent after this.</p>
        <br>

        <p>
          As the family grew, in size and number, we found we had 2
          adults, a rapidly growing tween (with friends), and a big hound. And our
          desire to camp only grew. So around the end of 2018 camping season, we
          started talking about a new camper.  Something a little more modern, and
          a little larger than the little 15 year old Aliner. We did some research
          and realized that, while we wanted more space, we also wanted to make
          sure  we kept it small enough so we could easily get into most
          campgrounds. We thought through how we'd use it, and realized that James
          would soon want to bring friends on our trips. So, we needed beds for
          4...  This all added up to
          <a href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/2019wolfpupbrochure.pdf">2019
            Forest River Wolf Pup 16BHs - Black Label Edition</a>, seen above.
          </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        <strong>The key features for us in choosing the 16BHS model were:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Total length under 20' (common cut-off length for smaller sites)</li>
          <li>Queen size (almost) bed, enough room for 2 adults</li>
          <li>Bunk beds for James and a friend</li>
          <li>Shower</li>
          <li>A good sized fridge</li>
          <li>Plenty of storage</li>
          <li>Towable by a reasonable family vehicle (3,100lbs empty, 3,900lbs full) </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <img src="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/FRWP16BHS.jpg">Forest River 16BHS
        layout</img>
        <br><br>

        <p>We also upgraded and got the "Black Label Edition".  Many of the
          upgrades are cosmetic:
          <ul>
            <li>Fiberglass body </li>
            <li>Alloy rims </li>
            <li>Frameless windows </li>
            <li>Solid wood cabinet doors </li>
            <li>Nice counter top </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          And, I'm not gonna lie,
          the asthetic impact of the fiberglass body and rimless windows was a
          pretty big factor in our choice to go with the upgrade.

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
          <em>But</em> there were also a few practical upgrades with the Black
          Label trim level:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deeper sink with pull out faucet</li>
          <li>Built-in battery disconnect</li>
          <li>Battery Minder (voltage gauge)</li>
          <li>Upgraded mattresses on all the beds </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
          And, there were a few features we weren't/aren't planning on using,
          but who knows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Microwave </li>
          <li>Air conditioner</li>
          <li>Toilet </li>
          <li>HD TV antenna</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The microwave and the AC require externalel ectricity.
          &nbsp&nbspAnd, even when we have a site with power, we don't use them.
          Maybe if its hot enough we'll use the AC someday... I will say, when I'm
          working on the camper in the driveway on hot days, I've been known to
          put it on.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, sites we go to (so far) have decent bathroom
          setups. So, we haven't yet used the toilet in the camper.  Why deal with
          pumping it out if you don't have to?
        </p>
        <p>
          And the OTA TV antenna is also pretty pointless. If we watch
          something, its something streamed or downloaded.
        </p>

            Mattress Upgrade
          </h4>
          <p>
            Even though the Black Label edition has an upgraded
            mattress, its still pretty thin. So, we added a
            <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/B00XKJKKGW/" target="_blank">
              memory foam mattress topper
            </a>.
            This makes the thin mattress a bit thicker, and helps to make up
            for the mattress sitting on a plywood platform with no give or flex.

            Speaker Upgrade
          </h4>
          <p>
            We like music. A lot. Our whole house is wired for  sound.
            Bedrooms, kitchen, living room, playroom, a bathroom, and even
            the deck (complete with subwoofer).  And, while we don't blast our
            tunes while camping, its still nice to have decent sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Wolf Pup came with a sound system which included radio,
            bluetooth and an indoor zone and an outdoor zone. But, the speakers
            were junk. So,one of the first upgrades I did was to replace the
            inside speakers with a pair of
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EXOTD56/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
            target="_blank"> Polk DB652 6.5" speakers</a>.  I chose these
            because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Polk makes a decent speaker for the cost.  I've got 2 pairs
              in my Wrangler and they sound great.</li>
            <li>They're efficient (92 dB sensitivity) so they do well making
              good sound out of little power, important given the somewhat
              anemic head unit.</li>
            <li>They've got a decent lower end for the size (these preceded
              the <a href="#Subwoofer">subwoofer</a>)</li>
            <li>The marine IP55 certification means the elements will never
              be a problem (yes, they're inside, but still..)</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable</li>
            <li>They fit the stock holes (right diameter, not too deep) and
              they're light-weight enough that the thin ceiling can still
              support them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All in all, they sound pretty good.   The head unit is still too
            underpowered to get <em>really</em> good sound.  But this is a huge
            step up.  And, to round out this upgrade, I had to add a...</p>
          </section>
          <br><br>

          <!-- Subwoofer content -->
          <section id="Subwoofer">
            <h4>Subwoofer</h4>
            <p>Maddox teases me and says I add a subwoofer to everything.  All
              this because I added a
              <a href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/DeckSub.jpg"> weather-proof
              12" sub to our deck sound system!</a> (And, it sounds <em>amazing
              </em>, btw). Anyway...
            </p>
            <p>So, even after the upgrade of the interior speakers, there was
              still very little low end.  Again, we're <em>not</em> cranking
              music for the entire campground.  But, I like decent sound, even
              at very low volumes. So, I added a small sub to the camper.
            </p>

            <p>I wanted to keep the install simple, and I didn't need much
              power, and I certainly didn't want something that would drain the
              camper's batteries.  So, after a bit of research I decided to go
              with this little
              <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079PRCP9W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">
              8" active sub from Rockville</a>. The size, cost, and power were
              perfect for my needs.   It also has an auto on/off feature which
              I thought I would use, but ultimately I decided that I wanted to
              be able to turn the sub off even when listening to music (for
              example, late at night). So I ended up putting in a toggle switch
              to control power to the sub.
            </p>

            <p>
              Installation was pretty easy. I ran power and signal from the
              back of the Furion head unit to the sub, which I located under
              the bed right by the access hatch. The signal was easy as the
              head unit has a
              <a href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/HeadUnitRear.jpg">
                subwoofer output
              </a>.
              I mounted the sub on a hinged piece of
              wood just inside the exterior access hatch for the under-bed
              storage. The idea is that its tucked away, pointing into the
              camper most of the time. But if we ever do want to use the sub
              with the external speakers, we can simply open the exterior
              hatch, and swing the sub into the opening.
            </p>

            <!-- TODO: Caesar, add a pic of the subwoofer from the outside -->
            <p>
              While I don't use it as much as I though I would (again, we work
              hard not to distrub other campers), when I do use it, it makes a
              world of difference in the sound.
