        <h4>Savoy Mountain State Forest Gallery</h4>
        <p>Savoy State Park is located in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts. Coming from Boston it’s about a two and a half hour drive most of which is on Route 2. This park is very close to <a href="mohawk.html">Mohawk Trail State Forest</a>, they’re only about ten miles apart. Savoy is a little bit harder to get to than Mohawk which is literally right off Route 2 so seems to be visited a little less. North Adams is the closest town which is about a fifteen minute drive from the campground.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a pretty small campground that has only one loop that has 45 campsites. There is also a group camping area and several cabins that are on a road directly off this loop. The campsites that are located on the inside of the loop are in a field with no trees, so they’re a lot more open. Although, this is such a small campground, it still doesn’t feel that crowded. The campsites on the outside of the loop have trees surrounding them so they offer a little more privacy, however many of them are pretty close to the road that goes around the loop. If this was a larger campground it would feel more crowded but we had a site that was almost directly on the road and it didn’t bother me all that much. If you're planning on tent camping and would like to be a little further away from people, I would suggest checking out sites 27-32. That side of the loop has quite a bit of distance from the rest of the campsites. Be aware that they are more open though. There are a scattering of trees on that side and a lot of shrubs but it's not as heavily wooded as the other side of the loop.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are two ponds in the park, North Pond and South Pond. North Pond is larger and a bit more of a hike to get to, it does have a beach and swimming area. South Pond is much more accessible, there is a short trail that runs between a couple campsites that leads directly to the pond. People left their kayaks/canoes here, since it’s only accessible to those camping in the park it seems pretty safe to leave your boats here. It’s a pretty pond but probably better suited to boating than swimming. There were a lot of cute frogs in the pond when we were there. There are several hiking trails that start in the park and and there are plenty of other trailheads in the area. This area also has lots of rivers that are great for fishing or rafting.</p>
