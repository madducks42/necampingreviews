              We're both long-time tent campers.  But, a while back, I realized
              that more <em>convenience</em> and <em>comfort</em> means we can take
              more trips...</p>
            </p>
            <p>
              I started with a little Aliner hard-sided pop-up.
              It was just big enough for James (3 or 4 years old at the
              time) and myself. The key was that I could pack it up in advance... in
              fact I'd leave most of our gear in the camper... come home from work
              on a Friday, and take off for a weekend of camping. It also had
              a little 3-way fridge (and sink and stove), which meant I could
              also pack the food up the night before. Add in a "real" bed, and
              its clear why we barely used our tent after this.
              <br>
              It was also easily towed by my red Jeep Wrangler (the Rock Lobster),
              another plus...

              As the family grew, in size and number, we found we had 2
              adults, a rapidly growing tween (with friends), and a big hound. And our
              desire to camp only grew. So around the end of 2018 camping season, we
              started talking about a new camper.  Something a little more modern, and
              a little larger than the little 15 year old Aliner. We did some research
              and realized that, while we wanted more space, we also wanted to make
              sure  we kept it small enough so we could easily get into most
              campgrounds. We thought through how we'd use it, and realized that James
              would soon want to bring friends on our trips. So, we needed beds for
              4...
              <br>
              This all added up to
              <a href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/2019wolfpupbrochure.pdf">
                2019 Forest River Wolf Pup 16BHs - Black Label Edition
              </a>, seen up top.
              <br><br>

              <strong>The key features for us in choosing the 16BHS model were:
              </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Total length under 20' (common cut-off length for smaller sites)</li>
                <li>Queen size (almost) bed, enough room for 2 adults</li>
                <li>Bunk beds for James and a friend</li>
                <li>Shower</li>
                <li>A good sized fridge</li>
                <li>Plenty of storage</li>
                <li>Towable by a reasonable family vehicle (3,100lbs empty, 3,900lbs full) </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              We also upgraded and got the "Black Label Edition".  Many of the
              upgrades are cosmetic:
              <ul>
                <li>Fiberglass body </li>
                <li>Alloy rims </li>
                <li>Frameless windows </li>
                <li>Solid wood cabinet doors </li>
                <li>Nice counter top </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              And I'm not gonna lie,
              the asthetic impact of the fiberglass body and rimless windows was a
              pretty big factor in our choice to go with the upgrade.
              <br>

            </div>

            <p>
              <em>But</em>, there were also a few practical upgrades with the Black
              Label trim level:
              <ul>
                <li>Deeper sink with pull out faucet</li>
                <li>Built-in battery disconnect</li>
                <li>Battery Minder (voltage gauge)</li>
                <li>Upgraded mattresses on all the beds </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
              And there were a few features we weren't/aren't planning on using,
              but who knows:
              <ul>
                <li>Microwave </li>
                <li>Air conditioner</li>
                <li>Toilet </li>
                <li>HD TV antenna</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The microwave and the AC require external electricity.
              And even when we have a site with power, we don't use them.
              Maybe if its hot enough we'll use the AC someday... I will say, when I'm
              working on the camper in the driveway on hot days, I've been known to
              put it on.
            </p>
            <p>
              And sites we go to (so far) have decent bathroom
              setups. So, we haven't yet used the toilet in the camper.  Why deal with
              pumping it out if you don't have to?
            </p>
            <p>
              And the OTA TV antenna is also pretty pointless. If we watch
              something, its something streamed or downloaded.

              <h4>Mattress Upgrade</h4>
              <p>
                Even though the Black Label edition has an upgraded
                mattress, its still pretty thin. So, we added a
                <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/B00XKJKKGW/" target="_blank">
                  memory foam mattress topper
                </a>.
                This makes the thin mattress a bit thicker, and helps to make up
                for the mattress sitting on a plywood platform with no give or flex.

              <h4>Under-bed Storage Unit</h4>
              <p>
                This is one of my favorite mods.  Most of the stuff listed here is
                pretty straight forward "replace this with that", "just order this
                and bolt it on", or you can find three YouTube videos showing you
                what to do.  Not this one.
              </p>
              <p>
                It started out as a place to put shoes.   Mostly because the family
                would come in for the night, and everyone would leave their shoes in
                front of the door in case they were needed for a bathroom break
                while half asleep.   After tripping over the shoes a few times, I
                started looking for a new place for them.  My original thought was
                to knock out the side panel on one of the dining table bench seats
                and make a cubby under there.   But we already use that space for
                other things. Then I realized that the storage space under the bed
                is huge.   And while we do store things under there (chairs,
                screen tent, etc), there was still plenty of room.
              </p>

              <p>
                At this point we'd had the Gray Ghost for just about a year.  So,
                it wasn't brand new, but its still in pretty nice shape.   So, what
                ever modfication I did had to look decent.  I'm "handy", but not a
                great woodworker.  So I started looking for some existing storage
                unit that was the right size and color for the task...  Ikea to the
                rescue!.  Ikea has a
                <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/besta-tv-unit-black-brown-90294512/"
                target="_blank"> dark brown TV stand called the "BESTÅ"</a>.
                It was exactly the right height and length, and you can choose the
                shelves, and/or drawers to put in it.  The dark brown (the same
                "Espresso" dark brown Ikea uses for everything) matched the
                interior of the camper enough so it doesn't stand out, and almost
                looks original.
              </p>

              <p>
                I decided to set it up with one shelf and a short drawer on one
                side, and a deeper drawer on the other.  But the internal
                configuration is easy to change (and you buy all those parts
                separately. The shelf is perfect for flip-flops, and sneakers.
                And so it the short drawer.  So far we've used the deeper one for
                beverage storage.
              </p>

              <p>
                Honestly, the hardest part was finding the right piece of furniture
                to put in there.  Once I got it home (and assembled it), the next
                step was to remove the "paneling" on the side of the bed (see the
                first photo, below).  This is all attached with little staples, so
                with the bed lifted it was easy enough to push it out from the back.
                With the paneling off, I had to remove a bed frame support in the
                middle of the area I was going to put the storage unit in.  I
                probably could have relied on the storage unit carrying the weight
                (its pretty solid) but I also put new supports in either side of the
                storage unit.
              </p>

              <p>
                With the "framing" in place, I layed the paneling on the ground
                (face down) and put the storage unit (also face down) on top of it.
                I traced the unit onto the back of the paneling and <em>very</em>
                slowly/carefully cut out the hole with a jig saw.  Once I was sure
                the cut out would fit around the storage unit, I put the unit in the
                camper.  Next I put the paneling in place, dry-fitting it all. A
                little trimming, and a tiny shim under the storage unit, and the
                fit came out even better than I expected.  I put a few tiny nails
                in the paneling to hold it in place, then drove a few long screws
                through the floor of the storage unit into the floor.  And a few
                through the bed frame into the top of the storage unit.  Then a few
                more nails into the paneling, and... done!

              <h4>Inside Speaker Upgrade</h4>
              <p>
                We like music. A lot. Our whole house is wired for  sound.
                Bedrooms, kitchen, living room, playroom, a bathroom, and even
                the deck (complete with subwoofer).  And while we don't blast our
                tunes while camping, its still nice to have decent sound.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Wolf Pup came with a sound system which included radio,
                bluetooth and an indoor zone and an outdoor zone. But, the speakers
                were junk. So,one of the first upgrades I did was to replace the
                inside speakers with a pair of
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EXOTD56/"
                target="_blank"> Polk DB652 6.5" speakers</a>.  I chose these
                because:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Polk makes a decent speaker for the cost.  I've got 2 pairs
                  in my Wrangler and they sound great.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They're efficient (92 dB sensitivity) so they do well making
                  good sound out of little power, important given the somewhat
                  anemic head unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They've got a decent lower end for the size (these preceded
                  the <a href="#Subwoofer">subwoofer</a>)
                </li>
                <li>
                  The marine IP55 certification means the elements will never
                  be a problem (yes, they're inside, but still..)
                </li>
                <li>
                  The price was reasonable
                </li>
                <li>
                  They fit the stock holes (right diameter, not too deep) and
                  they're light-weight enough that the thin ceiling can still
                  support them.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                All in all, they sound pretty good.   The head unit is still too
                underpowered to get <em>really</em> good sound.  But this is a huge
                step up.

              <h4>Subwoofer</h4>
              <p>
                Maddox teases me and says I add a subwoofer to everything.  All
                this because I added a
                <a href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/DeckSub.jpg" target="_blank">
                  weather-proof 12" sub to our deck sound system!
                </a>
                (And it sounds <em>amazing </em>, btw). Anyway...
              </p>

              <p>
                So, even after the upgrade of the interior speakers in the Wolf
                Pup, there was
                still very little low end.  Again, we're <em>not</em> cranking
                music for the entire campground.  But, I like decent sound, even
                at very low volumes. So, I added a small sub to the camper.
              </p>

              <p>
                I wanted to keep the install simple, and I didn't need much
                power, and I certainly didn't want something that would drain the
                camper's batteries.  So, after a bit of research I decided to go
                with this little
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079PRCP9W/" target="_blank">
                  8" active sub from Rockville
                </a>.
                The size, cost, and power were
                perfect for my needs.   It also has an auto on/off feature which
                I thought I would use.  But, ultimately I decided that I wanted to
                be able to turn the sub off even when listening to music (for
                example, late at night). So I ended up putting in a toggle switch
                to control power to the sub.  The switch lights up when the sub is
                on as an extra reminder to turn it off during quiet hours or when
                not in use.
              </p>

              <p>
                Installation was pretty easy. I ran power and signal from the
                back of the Furion head unit to the sub, which I located under
                the bed right by the access hatch. Finding a signal for the sub
                was easy as the head unit has an unused subwoofer output.
                I mounted the sub on a hinged piece of
                wood just inside the exterior access hatch for the under-bed
                storage. The idea is that its tucked away, pointing into the
                camper most of the time. But if we ever do want to use the sub
                with the external speakers, we can simply open the exterior
                hatch, and swing the sub into the opening.
              </p>

              <p>
                I don't use it as much as I thought I would.  Again, we work
                hard not to disturb other campers.  But, when I do use it, it makes a
                world of difference in the sound, even at low volumes.

              <h4>Overheard Cabinet Door Lifter</h4>
              <p>
                We tend to store food in the cabinets over the dining table.  These
                cabinets swing up, which make them space-efficient.  But its tough
                to dig around in the cabinet, and impossible to grab something with
                one hand.   So, in a common mod, we added
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H18I46K/" target="_blank">
                  gas struts (lifters)
                </a>
                to hold the doors open.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two tricks to this mod, finding the right strut, and the
                installation itself.  Struts vary in size (length) and power.  Size
                is key to ensuring the fit, and power is important to ensure the door
                stays open (and doesn't damage the frame).  For this application I
                used 10 lb, 10 inch struts, and they worked perfectly.  They're strong
                enough to hold the door open, but still easy to close.
              </p>
              <p>
                The slightly more challenging part was the actual installation.  If
                your cabinets are solid wood, then you don't have much to worry
                about.  The doors on our cabinets are solid wood (thanks to the Black
                Label Edition) but the cabinet frames are still particle board.
                And over time, the pressure from the strut when closing will rip
                the screws out of particle board.  So, I mounted a short piece of
                2x2 to the back of the cabinet face (stained to match the cabinets)
                and mounted the lower end of the struct to that.  Note that the 2x2
                is resting on the bottom of the cabinet to help absorb the
                constant downward pressure when the cabinet is closed.

              <p>
                This is very similar to the
                <a href="#CabinetDoorLifter">Overhead cabinet door lifter</a>
                mod.  But instead of holding
                cabinet doors open, struts are used to hold the lid to the under-
                seat storage open.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here I used
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VY2GVB9/"
                target="_blank"> 4.5lb, 8" struts</a>.
                You can just slap these on, but I wanted to make it so you didn't
                need to remove the seat cushion, which required cutting and
                hinging the storage "lid" a few inches from the back edge.  A
                loop of thin rope through a hole in the lid serves as a "handle"
                to make lifting the lead easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                This mod makes this storage space a lot more usable.  We typically
                store food in reuable grocery bags (fit perfectly) and the
                kitchen utensil "jar" here during travel.

                This is another of my favorites.  More often than not, we're
                camping on batteries.  And while we do have 4 of them, we try
                to make each one last.  So, that means turning off lights when
                we're not using them.  This mod not only turns off the lights when
                we're out of the camper (common during dinner prep,
                for example), but it also turns them on "hands-free" when we
                enter.
              </p>
              <p>
                The key is a
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JLB0GM6/" target="_blank">
                  relatively cheap little 12V motion sensor switch
                </a>, and a little creative wiring.   At a minimum, I wanted the
                two main ceiling lights to be controlled by the motion sensor.
                Not knowing exactly how the lights were wired, I started by
                removing the ceiling light closest to the power center (located)
                under the fridge.  When I pulled the light from the ceiling, it
                was clear that the power came into the light, and then went on
                somewhere else.  The only way I could think of to figure out
                what else was powered by this wire was to cut it, and see what
                stopped working, which is what I did.  I was hoping all the
                lights in the camper would go out (and everything else would
                remain powered), but just the other ceiling light went out.
                That was good enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                This light is located right in front of the stereo head unit
                mounted in the overhead storage.  This was convenient because
                I wanted to mount the motion sensor on that cabinet, right in
                front of the entry door.   So, I spliced in
                a long loop of wire where I'd cut the power supply to the
                lights, and was able to fish it through the ceiling and drop it
                into the cabinet where the speaker wires ran from the head unit
                to the speakers (also in the ceiling).  With the "switch" wire
                in the cabinet, it was easy to staple it along the upper, inside
                of the front of the cabinet to get the wires opposite the door.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I ordered the motion sensor, I also picked up some of
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071LQFQ17/"
                target="_blank">these barrel power plug pigtails</a>.  These
                allow me to plug the motion sensor "in line" in the power supply
                to the ceiling lights.  It also allows me to easily remove the
                motion sensor and just plug the one end of the spliced-in wire
                into the other end, basically repairing the circuit I spliced
                and returning normal operation.  And that's actually how things
                are right now.   Once I find a SPDT switch that matches the ones
                already in the camper (probably something like
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UC8MOM/"
                target="_blank">this</a>, but SPDT) then I'll use the switch to
                override the motion sensor, making the lights work "normally".
                These ceiling lights have a built-in button switch that still
                operates and could confuse the whole thing a bit.  If the
                lights, themselves, are switched off, it won't matter if the
                motion sensor sends them power.   I may try to find an
                "On/Off/On" switch (and superglue the buttons on the lights in
                the "On" position).  Then I'd have a "wall" switch that could
                toggle between "Off", "On", and "Motion Sensor".
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, I read some less-than-great reviews of the motion sensor
                but its worked <em>perfectly</em> for us.  You can adjust the
                sensativity (to motion), and we've got ours set to it can detect
                you as you step up to the screen door from the outside.
                Literally, you hit the steps and the lights come on!  <br>
                You can also adjust the amount of time the lights stay on after
                the last motion was detected.  So, ours stay on for about 5 min,
                then go off.  But if you keep moving (or move at least once
                every 5 min) they stay on.  Exactly what we wanted.

              <h4>12V Power Outlet</h4>
              <p>
                I'd been thinking about adding a 12 volt power outlet (a
                "cigarette lighter" style jack) for a while.  I wasn't sure what
                I'd use it for (there are USB jacks all over the place) but I
                knew some day the need would come.   And it did.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it became clear that working from home was a long-term thing
                during the summer of 2020, Maddox tried to book as many campsites
                as possible.   My company's vacation policy is pretty great, but
                it was clear that I'd have to work on some of these trips.  I'm
                fortunate that I can work just about anywhere with a laptop, and
                internet.  But as we started looking at longer trips I needed a
                way to charge the laptop.  See the
                <a href="#MacbookCharger"> Macbook Charger</a> I use on the road,
                below.  And this thing can pull a fair amount of power, and be
                plugged in for a while, so I needed an outlet up to the task
                (lots of stories of cheap sockets melting out there).
              </p>
              <p>
                With this mod I had a few concerns...  primarily not killing the
                battery, and not starting a fire.
              </p>
              <p>
                I thought about putting some sort of battery alarm in, but the
                camper came with a voltmeter gauge built-in, and it does a good
                job of letting me know the state of the battery.  I tend to watch
                it closely when I'm using the battery a lot.  And worst case I
                bring spare batteries and can recharge via the
                <a href="#Solar">solar setup</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "not starting a fire" requirement primarily meant the
                components had to be up to the task, and a little protection
                needed to be installed.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the outlet, a quick search revealed that just about
                every outlet on Amazon has at least one reviewer talking about
                the outlet overheating and melting.  But I found
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K0TQ94C/1" target="_blank">
                  this one
                </a> with an all-metal body, and a fair amount of air-space around
                it to keep it cool.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next up was the wire. I really just wanted to make
                sure that, like the outlet, the wiring was up to the task.
                Primarily meaning weather-proof, and thick enough to keep cool
                under load.  For cost and performance, I ended up using outdoor
                rated 12-2 wire from the big-box hardware store.  The wire is
                only 10 feet long, and even if the laptop charger is pulling the
                full 90W its capable of, that's no where near the capacity of the
                wire.  While the wire is outdoor rated, its also tucked into the
                existing wireloom where exposed to the elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, since this thing is directly connected to the battery,
                I wanted to include some short protection. I opted for this
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NSFHT2V/" target="_blank">
                  auto-reset 12V circuit breaker
                </a>.  This is the same style of
                <a href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/powerjack1.jpg" target="_blank">
                  protection used by the RV manufacturer
                </a>.  It will protect the circuit, and I won't need to replace a
                fuse if I do overload it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wiring this up was pretty straight forward.  The existing breaker
                and an electrical box are located right behind the battery
                <a href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/powerjack3.jpg" target="_blank">
                  on the back of a frame rail
                </a>.  The battery cable from the battery to the hot side of the
                existing breaker is a standard car battery cable, and certainly
                up to the load I'm adding to it.  I used the "hot" terminal of the
                existing circuit breaker to tap into the power, and ran a little
                "jumper" to the new/additional breaker, which I put inside this
                conveniently located electrical box for a bit of extra weather
                protection.  There was an existing ground screw inside there as
                well which made that easy.  Added my 12-2 cable to the other end
                of the new breaker, ran it out of the electrical box, along the
                frame, and up inside the cabin through an existing plumbing hole.
                I sealed the hole with "great stuff" (basically what it was
                originally sealed with), and then I had my fault-protected hot
                wire inside the cabin.
              </p>
              <p>
                For esthetics, and ease, I mounted the outlet under the bed as
                well, to the back side of the
                <a href="#StorageUnit">storage unit</a> I installed.  Its out of
                the way, but easily accessible.

              <h4>Stabilizer Jack Replacement</h4>
              <p>
                On our third or fourth trip with the Gray Ghost, I was backing it
                into a campsite in the dark.  The ground was uneven, and I ended
                up catching the two front stabilizer jacks on the ground.  While
                mostly still functional, they were bent up, tough to crank, and a
                lot of the paint flaked off (see the pics, below).  I figured
                replacement would be straight forward, but given the price of a
                decent replacement, I decided to fix one first.   I ordered
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZOJADQ/" target="_blank">
                  this as a replacement
                </a>.  Its defintiely heavier-duty than the
                original.  Installation wasn't hard, but it didn't just bolt right
                in in-place of the original.   Two of the four mounting holes lined
                up, but I had to drill the other two.  This jack didn't come with
                mounting hardware, but I had a few grade-5 bolts just the right
                size laying around.  Bolted it right in.  And its definitely
                more solid than the original.   At some point, I'll replace the
                other less-bent one.

              <h4>Cell Booster</h4>
              <p>
                Normally we go camping to "get away".  So, having poor or no
                connectivity is just fine.   But, as I mentioned, over the
                summer of 2020 we had a lot of trips planned, and I needed to
                work through some of them.  With the
                <a href="#12VPowerOutlet">power outlet</a> and
                <a href="#MacbookCharger">laptop charger</a>, the only other thing
                I need is a reliable cell/data signal.  So, I started looking
                into cellphone boosters.  After a little research, I learned a
                few things:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>These things are <em>boosters</em>.  This means there needs
                  to be <em>some</em> signal for them to boost.  If there's no
                  signal, these are useless.
                </li>
                <li>You need to get one that works for your carrier(s).  Different
                  carriers (Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, etc) use different
                  frequencies and bands.  Some boosters only support one
                  carrier, some support multiple, but I don't believe any
                  (affordable ones) support them all.
                </li>
                <li>These devices are basically two antennas with a booster in
                  the middle.  (This is over-simplified, but...)  Think of it
                  as one antenna (the external one) that pulls the signal in,
                  and sends it to the booster box.  The booster amplifies the
                  signal, and rebroadcasts via the local antenna for your phone
                  or hotspot to connect to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One major difference between models is the amount of space
                  they can cover with the local (rebroadcasting) antenna.  In
                  short, how close do you need to stand to the antenna with
                  your phone.  As an example, for the brand I bought (not the
                  model) local coverage of up to 6,000 sqft costs ~$550, And
                  coverage for 10,000 sqft costs ~$700.  Again, I didn't buy
                  either of these.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another major difference is how they "help" you point the
                  antenna.  Fancy ones have a display right on the booster.
                  Cheaper ones use an app on your phone to help you find the
                  best signal.  Basic ones have an LED on the booster that
                  indicates "ok" or not.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ones designed for mobile use an omni-directional antenna.
                  This is an antenna that doesn't have a front or back, and
                  recieves a signal equally well from any direction... but not
                  necessarily "well".  The other type of antenna, the ones used
                  by most non-mobile systems is directional, and must be pointed
                  at the cell tower your boosting (not necessary with the
                  omni-directional ones).  This requires more work to
                  set up, but directional antennas can pull in weaker signals
                  than omni-directional ones.   They're used in non-mobile
                  systems because, while they're more work to set up (aim), you
                  only have to do it once, and... they work better.  Mobile
                  systems are typically more expensive, and have shorter local
                  range (because you're usually in the car with the internal
                  antenna).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most (all?) boosters require significant distance/seperation
                  between the antennas so that the receiving antenna doesn't
                  pick up the signal from the local antenna and create a
                  feedback loop.  The stronger the booster, the more seperation
                  required.   And verticle seperation is best (mounting the
                  receiving one up high, like on a roof).
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                So, once I figured out the basics about how these things work, I
                made a few decisions.  First, I was a bit skeptical that they
                would really solve my problem, so I wasn't willing to dump a TON
                of money into the really high-end ones.
                <br>
                Next, I decided that to save money, <em>and</em> get better
                performance, I would buy one designed to be stationary (i.e. not
                mobile) and adapt it for my needs.  This meant it would need to
                be able to run off 12V DC (or less), and I'd need to figure out
                how to making setup (aiming the antenna) relatively easy.
                <br>
                On that last note (making setup easy), that ruled out the cheapest
                models with the simple LED that helps you aim.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ended up getting the
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0871SZQDW/" target="_blank">
                  HiBoost Dot
                </a>.  I chose this one because:
                <ul>
                  <li>It supported Verizon and T-Mobile (my carrier and Maddox's)
                    to maximize our chance of being able to find a signal that
                    worked for at least one of us.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It connects to an app on your phone via bluetooth to help you
                    aim the exterior antenna.  Way more helpful than a green LED.
                  </li>
                  <li>Reviews were solid.</li>
                  <li> Price was ok.</li>
                  <li>Part of the reason it was on the cheaper end (for these
                    devices) is because it doesn't cover much area, locally.
                    But since I
                    figured I'd use it in the camper, or immediately outside, I
                    didn't need a lot of sq ft coverage.  This one covers up to
                    1,000 sq ft.  And in hindsight this is probably the unit's
                    biggest weakness.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Once I had the booster, I had two things to figure out: power and
                the externa antenna mount (and aiming).
              </p>
              <p>
                For power, I had an unused
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019RKVMKU/" target="_blank">
                  step-down regulator
                </a> floating around from a previous project.  This would take the
                12+ VDC from a camper (car) battery or the
                <a href="#12VPowerOutlet">power outlet</a> and drop it down to the
                5VDC required by the booster.  I threw this in a project box with
                a cigarette lighter plug on the input, and a barrel plug on the
                output.  Power solved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next was the antenna.  The receiving antenna that had to be about
                20 feet higher than the local/transmitting antenna.  Obvious answer
                here?  PVC pipe!
              </p>
              <p>
                I took two 10 foot pieces of PVC pipe, one 2" in diameter, and
                the other 1-1/2", and slid one inside the other, overlapping by
                about 1 foot. I drilled a hole through the overlap, and put an
                eye bolt through (I had one laying around, and easy to screw in
                by hand).  This gave me a 19' tall mast.  I knew I'd attach it
                to the back of the camper, and resting on the rear bumper gave me
                another 2' of height.
              </p>
              <p>
                To secure the bottom of the mast I needed something that would
                hold it from sliding around, but let me rotate the mast easily
                for aiming.  I ended up using
                <a href="Resources/Images/TrailerMods/PVCflange.jpg"
                target="_blank">a PVC flange</a> held to the bumper with a
                bungee cord.  Easy to set up, cheap, and not permanent (in case
                this whole thing didn't work).
              </p>
              <p>
                For the securing the top end, I (initially) took the easy route
                and used a few ratchet straps looped over the roof and down the
                sides of the camper.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the first trip with this setup, I got some... uh...
                "feedback" from my better half that I was making the camper look
                trashy with those neon straps and the PVC pipe.  So a minor
                makeover was in order for the antenna and mast.
                <br>
                The mast got a coat of gray paint (matches the camper), the
                neon straps were replaced with black, and the antenna got a
                big old pair of googley eyes.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few other things to note about the setup... <br>
                It was pointed out that my cable management is for shit.  I
                should have run the antenna coax inside the mast.
                <br>
                The mast collapses down to 10', and I store/carry is strapped
                to the camper frame with a few heavy bungee cords.
              </p>

              <p>
                So, that's the set up... but how does it work?
              </p>
              <p>
                First... aiming the thing.  The app does a good job showing you
                the strength of the signal its picking up... with a minor
                exception.  The signal strength gauge in the app isn't updated in
                real-time.  So you need to adjust the angle and wait about 5
                seconds to see a response on the gauge.  And a degree or two
                can make a meaningful difference.  5 seconds doesn't sound like
                very long, but getting it perfectly aimed typically takes about
                10 minutes because of this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aiming is also tricky because, at least for us, we're trying to
                find the best position for two different frequencies (one for
                her phone on T-Mobile, and one for mine on Verizon).  There's a
                gauge for each, and we have to find the right balance between
                the two.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the recieving antenna is set up, we need to set up the
                local/transmitting antenna.  As I mentioned above, this antenna
                is pretty weak, and has very little range.  So I tend to move
                it around a lot (its on a 30' coax cable) to position it near
                wherever I'm working.  And proximity of the phone to the
                local antenna makes a big difference in connection speed.  I may
                get almost no signal 10 feet away, but 3 or 4 bars with the
                phone right up against the antenna.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since I'm mostly using this setup for internet access, I tend to
                turn on the hotspot on my phone, which has pretty good range,
                and then put the phone right next to the local antenna.  This lets
                me move around easily, work where I want, and still keep a
                decent signal.  But its a bit annoying if I actually want to use
                the phone.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wish the entire setup process (assembling the mast, setting it
                up, aiming, power, etc) were a bit easier, and I do have some
                ideas for improvements here.  And I wish the range on the local
                antenna was better.   In hindsight, I should have spent a bit more
                to get better local range.
              </p>
              <p>
                But, all in all, I'm happy with the setup.  It has definitely
                enabled me to take trips that I wouldn't have been able to
                without it, due to work.

            <section id="Camera" class="anchor">
              <h4>Rearview Camera</h4>
              <p>
                I don't have a ton of experience towing, so I knew I wanted to
                make it as easy on myself as possible.   So I knew that adding
                a rear view camera was going to happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did a bit of research and found that, like so many things, you
                can find cheap (less expensive) options, and you can pay a
                fortune.  I tend to be sort of cheap, figring that I can hack an
                "ok" product into being a "good" product.  Especially electronics.
              </p>
              <p>
                For backup/rear-view cameras, there are two main "flavors":
                wired and wireless.  Given the relatively short trailer, and the
                fact that I don't need <em>perfect</em> video here, I decided to go
                for the easier installation, and chose wireless.   After shopping
                around, I landed on
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q2GJGHS/" target="_blank">
                  this setup from XeoroxClub
                </a>.  The price was reasonable, and the reviews were good.
                When the unit showed up, quality appeared to be about what I
                expected.  I was pleased to see that the camera body was die-cast
                metal and not plastic that would crack in the elements after a few
                months.
              </p>
              <p>
                The display unit simply plugs into the cigarette outlet in your
                car.  You could hardwire it, but I stash mine away when I'm not
                towing, and I don't use the outlet, so hardwiring didn't make
                sense for me.  I originally tried to just set the display on the
                dash, resting it on the "foot" that came with it, but it frequently
                fell over.  Again, I didn't want to attach it to the car, so I
                found
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U5TUWE/" target="_blank">
                  this weighted "friction dash pad"
                </a>
                and I zip-tied the monitor base to this.  Now I can just set the
                camera monitor on my dash and its completely stable, and easy to
                move. (See the pics below.)
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                The next step in the installation is the camera, itself.  There
                are two parts to this: attaching the camera to the camper, and
                the wiring.
              </p>
              <p>
                The camera isn't too heavy, so I just drilled <em>small</em>
                holes in the back of the camper, filled them with silicone caulk
                and screwed the camera bracket to the wall.  I mounted it
                relatively high on the wall for a few reasons.  First, I thought
                the chances of me finding something solid (wood) to screw into
                were better up there.  Next, the higher up, the better angle I'd
                have to judge distance for things behind the camper.  And last,
                I was hoping that having the antenna poke up above the camper
                would get me a stronger signal, as opposed to having to travel
                through or around the camper.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the wiring... I took the easy approach.  Some people have
                written up articles about how they drilled into the cabin and
                found a power source in there.  Instead, I opted to tap into the
                power for the running lights located right under the camera.  I
                did a little research about the power consumption of the camera
                to ensure I wouldn't overload anything, but in the end I just
                tried it out, and it worked great.
                <br>
                Now, when the lights are on, the camera is on.  And honestly,
                this has saved me a few times.  Sometimes I'll hook the camper
                to the tow vehicle while prepping to hit the road, but I'll
                intentionally not connect the trailer wiring plug to the vehicle
                because I'm still running things (the fridge) off AC power.  I
                always remember to disconnect the house power from the camper,
                but I don't always remember to connect the camper wiring to the
                car.  BUT, because the camera works off the trailer lights, when
                I go to turn the camera on before driving away, its very clear
                that its not getting power (because I haven't plugged the trailer
                into the car).
              </p>
              <p>
                Tapping into the power is really easy.  Remove the running light,
                identify the + and - wire (mine were marked, but use a tester, if
                needed), splice in the camera wiring.  Easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                The slightly more challenging part is making sure its water
                tight.  When I removed the running light, I saw that it was sealed
                to the camper wall with some putty.  I little research showed that
                its a product like
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070O93HA/" target="_blank">
                  this.

                And this is what I used to seal it all around the camera
                power wire.  Stating the obvious, if you do this, run the wire
                out of the bottom edge of the light to ensure water doesn't run
                down the wire into the camper (learn about drip loops).  So far,
                no problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                All-in-all, the installation went fine.   And the camera worked
                pretty well.  Occaisionally, the video would freeze.  Best I could
                tell this was due to interference from other signals (rarely
                happened on the highway).  In an attempt to improve this, I made
                two changes.  The first, was I upgraded the antenna attached to
                the monitor.  The antenna on the monitor and the camera were these
                little 6" whip antennas.  And I replaced the camera antenna with
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NVG5YZG/" target="_blank">
                  this one from Amazon.
                </a>  I also replaced the monitor antenna with
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H57Q1B1/" target="_blank">
                  this one.
                </a>  The goal here was to get the antenna outside of the car,
                and a little closer to the camera.  Two comments about that
                antenna.  It was supposed to have magnets on it, but showed up
                without them.  The seller refunded my money, and let me keep the
                product.  I had a couple of small, high powered magnets laying around
                and superglued them into the base.  I then covered the base with
                duct tape to ensure it didn't scratch the paint on the roof of
                the car.
                The antenna upgrades worked well, and the signal is really solid
                now.

              <h4>Monitor</h4>
              <p>
                I mostly work on laptops, using just the built-in display.  But
                when it was clear that I'd be working from home for at least the
                entire summer of 2020, I decided to get a computer monitor for
                home.  While I was shopping around, I decided to keep my eye open
                for one that had HDMI inputs and could run off 12VDC (or less).
                Amazingly, I found exactly what I was looking for in
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0773ZY26F/" target="_blank">
                  this relatively cheap Sceptre 24" monitor
                </a>.  The size, inputs, and power requirements mean that I can
                easily use it in the camper as well as on my desk at home.
              </p>
              <p>
                And currently, that's exactly what I do (take it off my desk when
                we go camping).  But, for the $100 price tag, I may buy one just
                for the camper.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Wolf Pup came with a hanging bracket for a monitor.  There's
                actually one inside over the queen bed, and another outside on
                the side of the camper.  We only ever use the inside one.  For
                power, I have a cable with the appropriate barrel connecter on one
                end and a cigarette lighter plug on the other, which goes into the
                <a href="#12VPowerOutlet">power outlet</a>.  My phone has a USB-C
                port, to the USB-C-to-HDMI adapter for my laptop works perfectly
                to allow my phone to drive the monitor.  This means I can download
                Netflix shows to my phone for viewing on the monitor.
              </p>
              <p>
                And sometimes we'll load up an iPad with shows.  And for that,
                we use the...

              <h4>Tablet Mount</h4>
              <p>
                On the first few trips, we used the iPad for a little video
                entertainment before bed.  We'd lay in bed and prop it up on a
                pillow.  It would fall over every few minutes, and be uncomfortable
                to watch.  So I found
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZZYR4K/" target="_blank">
                  this tablet mount
                </a>.  It holds just about any size tablet,
                and even my phone, at just about any angle.  Its easy to mount
                and you can easily take down the majority of the mount, leaving
                just the mounting plate, without any tools if its in the way.

            <section id="Solar" class="anchor">
              <h4>Solar Suitcase</h4>
              <p>
                As mentioned above, more often than not, we're at sites without
                power.  So, we primarily rely on a few car batteries that we swap
                in when one goes flat.
                But, we'd rather not swap batteries and realize that eventually
                these will run out.   So, we started looking into solar.   Like
                many of these technologies that are new to me, I like to try them
                out a bit before committing (a lot of money).  So when it came to
                solar, it was clear that a "solar suitcase" (a sizable, but
                portable solar panel setup) was the right first step.  So, I
                studied up, shopped around and decided to go with
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079JVBVL3/" target="_blank">
                  this Renogy 100 watt, two panel solar suitcase
                </a>.  The nice thing about this setup is that its all self
                contained, and includes everything you need (the panels, the
                charge controller, and the battery hook-up cable).
              </p>
              <p>
                After buying this setup, I tried it out on a few trips.  The panels
                successfully replenished the power we use in 24 hours throughout a
                single sunny day (assuming about 8 hours in direct, bright sun).
                That said, its tough to keep anything on most campsites in bright
                sun all day.  And rarely do we have sunny days every day in a
                trip.  But, we have multiple batteries, so its not a problem.  But
                if we ever try a trip longer than 5 or 6 days with no external
                power along the way, we might have a problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                This setup is expandable, meaning that I could add another pair of
                panels to this existing controller, doubling the power generation
                capability.  As tempting as this is, we haven't needed it yet, and
                juggling twice as many panels isn't appealing.  So, I'm not doing
                this soon.
              </p>
              <p>
                One other tweak I eventally made to this system was to pick up
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N80C5BQ/" target="_blank">
                  this extension cable
                </a>,
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L2LFY1F/" target="_blank">
                  these connectors
                </a>, and
                <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/snapshot/0.html?spm=a2g0s.9042647.6.2.3f564c4dbmXFhc&orderId=102870707566605&productId=32892066092" target="_blank">
                  this connector
                </a>.
                The extension cable gave me more range and flexibility on where I
                place the panels.  And the connectors let me build a simple
                adapter to allow me to plug this system into the "solar ready"
                port on the camper (a DIY version of
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TC28ZLB?tag=solaraddict-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1" target="_blank">

              <h4>Keyless Lock for Underside Storage</h4>
              <p>
                This is another really easy mod.  I replaced the keyed "cam lock"
                with a combination lock for the outer hatch door that accesses
                the under-bed storage.
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7DBWA/" target="_blank">
                  This cam combinaton lock
                </a> was a drop-in replacement for the keyed lock on our storage
                hatch.  It saves us from having to hunt down the keys whenever
                we want something from storage, and means we lock it more
                frequently.  I also got
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ONNA42/" target="_blank">
                  this rubber dust cover
                </a> for it to make the lock last longer, and sort of hide the
                fact that there's a combination lock there.  This cover feels
                a little cheap and brittle, so I'm not expecting it to last very
                long.
                <br>
                Assuming this lock lasts, I'll likely replace the cam lock on the
                outdoor shower door as this lock sticks a lot.

                   these cup holder inserts on Amazon
                 </a>.  The color matches the camper perfectly, and they're big
                 enough to hold a beverage in a koozie.
                 <br>
                 Installation is easy.  Find a 3-1/2" hole saw, and cut a hole.
                 These inserts require a little pressure to get in place.  But
                 the snug is actually perfect to keep them in place.

               <h4>Battery Monitor</h4>
               <p>
                 The "Black Label" package on the <a href="#GrayGhost">Gray
                   Ghost
                 </a> came with a "battery minder", also known as a
                 voltmeter.  While it gives you a vague indication of the state of
                 your battery, its mostly along the lines of <em>OK</em>,
                 <em>Almost Not OK</em>, and <em>Not OK</em>.  You have to turn
                 off just about anything using the battery to get a decent
                 reading and even then its not very precise.  Note,
                 the gauge works as intended, but voltage (alone) doesn't tell you all
                 you want to know about the state of a battery.
               </p>
               <p>
                 And, again, we're rarely on site with power, so knowing what's
                 going on with the batteries is important to us.
                 <br>
                 Fundamentally, I want to know how much "time" I have left on
                 a battery, or how much is left in the "tank".
               </p>
               <p>
                 So, I started looking into better battery monitors.  To
                 oversimplify what I've learned....
                 <br>
                 The better/best battery monitors:
                 <ol>
                   <li>Determine the capacity of the battery (typically by
                     asking you to enter it each time you change the battery).
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     Keep track of what you pull out of the battery (more below)
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     Do some math to determine how much power is left, usually
                     presented as a percentage of the battery.
                   </li>
                 </ol>
               </p>
               <p>
                 This is considerably more accurate and informative than just
                 using voltage. With a meter that measures power used, you
                 can determine how much capacity you actually have (run a
                 battery till 'empty', measure what you use, and then you know
                 its capacity). Do it across all your batteries, add 'em up,
                 and you know your total capacity.
                 <br>
                 You can also  get a sense for the rate at which you consume
                 power (e.g. how many Ah (amp-hours) per day).
                 So, this lets you estimate how many days you can camp for off
                 the batteries you have.
               </p>
               <p>
                 It turns out that in the battery meter space, there's the
                 <a href="https://www.victronenergy.com/battery-monitors"
                 target="_blank">Victron line</a>, and there's everything else.
                 Just about everything else out there compares itself to the
                 Victron.   And while ultimately a fair bit more expensive, I
                 went with the Victron, too.  The big reason I chose the Victron
                 is because it measures the power being used (many meters do),
                 but it keeps track of what you've used. AND, it also makes it
                 really easy to update the meter's capacity setting for your
                 battery via an app that connects to the meter via bluetooth.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The Victron is one of the few meters that uses Ah-consumed
                 relative to Ah-in-the-battery-when-fully-charged to display
                 remaining capacity (most use voltage).
                 This makes it more accurate.  And the blue-tooth interface
                 makes it trivial to update the capacity remaining when you swap
                 batteries.   All this adds up to a better sense for the power
                 we're using, the power we have left in a given battery, and the
                 power we have left in the remaining batteries.
               </p>
               <p>
                 We don't have a battery bank.  We have a bunch of batteries,
                 and we swap them in as needed.  This means roughly
                 every two days I need to swap in a new battery.  And, to
                 effectively keep track of how much power we have left in the
                 current battery, we need to update the meter when we swap
                 batteries (tell the meter how much power is in the new
                 battery).  The
                 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victron-Energy-MONITOR-VTBMV-S-BMV-712-Battery">
                   Victron BMV-712</a> makes all of that easy.
                 </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                 Also, as mentioned above, we have the <a href="#Solar">
                   Solar Suitcase
                 </a>.  The Victron also measures Ah put back into the battery
                 via charging.  Again, this is a critical feature if we're going
                 to use solar and keep track of the power left in a battery.
               </p>
               <p>While on the topic of battery meters, one other point...
                 to measure the power-actually-used, battery meters use a
                 "shunt" which is a small monitoring device that sits between
                 the negative pole of the battery and the load (often carried
                 via ground/frame in cars, travel trailers, etc).  That means
                 all current from (and to) the battery flows through this
                 thing.  The shunt is connected to the monitor, and that's
                 how the monitor "knows" how much power is pulled from (or
                 pushed to) the battery.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Unfortunately, most shunts have some exposed circuitry, which
                 means they're not well suited to being inside your typical
                 tongue-mounted plastic battery box.  So, when I ordered the
                 monitor, I also order a box to house the shunt.

               <h4>External Speakers</h4>
               <p>
                 I'd been wanting to upgrade the external speakers since we got
                 the trailer.  The sound was soft, and muted, and didn't sound
                 good at low volumes.   But, we rarely use those speakers
                 (partly because of the sound quality, I'm sure), so it didn't
                 make sense to spend money on the upgrade.   Well, when we
                 pulled the camper out of storge this spring, one of the outside
                 speakers sound really distorted, and the other sounded slightly
                 distorted.  A little research turned up that
                 <a href="https://www.etrailer.com/Marine-Speakers/Way-Interglobal/324-000020.html" target="_blank">
                   these</a>
                 were the original speakers.  I found them listed somewhere else
                 for $9 each, which explains the poor sound and short life.
                 But, more importantly, it gave me an excuse to upgrade the
                 external speakers.
               </p>
               <p>
                 As mentioned above, while I like music when camping, I'm not
                 looking to blast it.   I'm looking for quality sound at
                 relatively low volumes.   And, also covered above,
                 <a href="#Subwoofer"> we have the sub-woofer
                 </a> for when we want high fidelity.
                 <br>
                 So, this means I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money on
                 high-end components.  Cost, water-resistance, size, and brand
                 name (and some experience) led me to choose a
                 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-db522-5-25-inch-300-watt-Altavoces/dp/B01EZWFNKA" target="_blank">
                   a pair of Polk Audio DB522.
                 </a>
                 These may look familiar becuase they're the 5-1/4-inch version
                 of the <a href="#InsideSpeakers">speakers I put inside.</a>
                 I probably could have gone with the same 6-1/2-inch version
                 but I was trying to make the swap as easy as possible, and
                 those would definitely require me to make a bigger hole in the
                 wall.   And, since we don't need it loud, these should do.
                 They are the same size as the originals, and will definitely
                 sound better.
               </p>
               <p>
                 You can see from the pictures below, they weren't very precise
                 when they cut the holes for the original speakers.  It looks
                 like they started with a (too-small) hole saw, then free-handed
                 a router to make the hole bigger.  But, you can't see it with
                 the speakers in place, so I guess is doesn't matter.
               </p>

            These aren't really mods, but they're useful things we've added

                Rechargable, dimmable reading light</a> - This is perfect
                when someone in the camper wants a <em>little</em> light so
                they can see without disturbing others.
                Its dimmable, produces white or orange-ish light (easier on the
                eyes) and is rechargeable via the plentiful USB ports.
              </li>
              <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085HCJLLQ/" target="_blank">
                Dimmable, USB-powered reading light</a> - This is a fair bit
                brighter than the other light.  The long goose-neck makes it
                great for shared, indirect ligth over the larger bed.
              </li>
              <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KR4JNCS/" target="_blank">
                Ladder</a> - Everyone so often you need to get on the roof,
                or wipe down the awning before rolling it up, or... whatever.
                So I found this little ladder, super light, and fits easily
                into either of the storage bays.

                Fridge thermometer/alarm</a> - we run the fridge on propane
                quite a bit as most sites we visit don't have power.  And
                while we carry spare propane, I'm alway nervous that we'll
                run out, the fridge will stop working, and we won't notice
                until its too late.   So I just picked up this thermometer
                with two remote sensors.  I'm going to throw one in the
                fridge and one in the freezer, and set the alarms
                appropriately.  Helpful tip someone shared, regular AA
                batteries don't do well in the cold, so I grabbed some

                </a> - I'm writing this over the summer of
                2020, and I'm working 100% remotely.  So why not do it from
                the camper?!  But to do so, I still need my computer.  And
                as we've mentioned, we often camp without external power.
                I work on a recent Macbook Pro, which charges via USB-C, and
                I thought any USB-C power source would work, but not the
                case.  If there's not enough power, the laptop won't even
                try to charge, the charging system is "smart".   So I found
                this charger, and it works well.   I did install a
                <a href="#12VPowerOutlet">12V power outlet with circuit
                  breaker
                </a> to handle the high power draw.  Betwen this, the

                <a href="#CellBoost">cell booster</a>, I should be able
                work from just about anywhere.

                The bugs love me.  And James.  We step out of the car when we get
                to a camp site (often around dusk), and the first thing we have
                to do is apply bug spray, or they chow on us.  Interestling, they
                don't seem to bother Maddox much (too bitter?).
                <br>Anyway... in addition to
                being extra-tasty to mosquitos, we also often camp near water.
                So, we're always prepared with bug spray, <em>and</em> this
                screen tent.
                We had a cheaper, lighter one, but it required a lot of guy
                lines and still collapsed everytime it got a bit windy.   Once I
                realized we'd almost always be camping with the camper, I stopped
                worrying about weight, and I found one that was stable, and
                quick/easy to set up.  It wasn't cheap, at almost $200, but its
                already lasted more than twice as long as the previous one (4
                seasons), and its still in great shape.   Its really easy to set
                up, <em>except</em> that its pretty heavy.  When its all packed
                into its bag, its just over 50lbs.  This is because of the sturdy
                metal folding frame.  So, I'd never use this if I had to carry
                it very far, but its perfect to set up over a picnic table next
                to the trailer if we're expecting rain (yes, the roof blocks the
                rain) or if its a buggy area.

        <h2>Subaru Ascent</h2>
        <p>
          Subaru's introduction of the
          <a href"https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/ascent/index.html"
          target="_blank">Ascent</a> in 2019 was also a motivating factor in
          getting the <a href="#GrayGhost">Gray Ghost</a>.  I had a leased
          Subaru Outback, and the lease was up.  We've been happy with our
          Subaru's (Maddox drives a WRX), and the dealership is close by, so
          I decided to look at the new Ascent.  The towing capacity caught my
          eye at 5,000 lbs, pretty good for a "mid-sized" SUV.  Interestingly,
          it delivers that towing capacity through a CVT hooked up with the
          same turbo'd 4 cyclinder in the WRX.  Yup, the Ascent with 5k lbs
          towing capacity has a 2.4L, 4 cylinder (~260 hp).
          And truth be told, when you're going up a hill pulling 4k lbs of
          trailer, you can hear the engine working.   That said, thanks to
          the CVT, it still responds quickly if you need a little more speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first 6 months I had the Ascent (first half of 2019), I
          was driving it to work every day, about ~40 miles, round trip.  It
          felt a lot bigger than the Outback, but I got used to it pretty
          quickly, and its a nice commuting car... other than the gas
          milage, which came in right around 20 - 25mpg (combination highway
          and city driving).
        </p>
        <p> I ordered our Ascent with the factory towing package.  This
          includes the
          hitch receiver, the ball-mount, a 4-way and a 7-way socket, and
          wiring for a brake controller.  But the controller itself isn't
          included.   I ordered
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P11SCM/"
            target="_blank">
            this proportional brake controller
          </a> and with the factory wiring harness, it was an easy install
          (twist a few wires together, mount the controller under the dash
          and, plug it in).  It was also easy to adjust for our trailer
          weight and brakes, and works well.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, overall we're pretty happy with our Ascent, nicknamed
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_the_Big_Red_Dog"
            target="_blank">Clifford.
          </a>.  Its a very comfortable ride, with
          room for up to 8, lots of USB ports, and solid towing capacity
          (for a comfy, usable SUV).  <br>
          The only complaint honestly is the radio.
          Subaru came out with poor radio design that doesn't really turn off
          when you hit the "off" button.  And when you restart the car, it
          comes on <em>really</em> loud by default.   Its a known, documented
          issue, and really annoying.
