        <h4>Moreau Lake State Park Gallery</h4>
        <p>Moreau Lake State Park is located in Eastern New York about ten miles north of Saratoga Springs. Coming from Boston it’s just over a three hour drive which made it a good stopping place for us on our way to <a href="letchworth.html">Letchworth State Park</a>. It would also make a good stopping place on your way to the Adirondacks. It’s a good state park for a weekend getaway or stop on the way to somewhere else.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are seven camping loops throughout the park. We stayed in Loop A which despite how crowded it looks on the map actually wasn't that bad. Most of the sites have a decent amount of space between them and the trees add to the privacy. Loops B & E offer a little more space and aren't quite as crowded but the woods aren't as dense so they don't feel quite as private. Loops C & D are not lakeside but you can see glimpses of the lake through the trees, getting to this loop does mean driving up a fairly steep and rough road. I would avoid Loops G & F unless absolutely necessary, those loops were the most packed and the farthest from the lake. The campground also offers several cabins, two of which are on the lake, Sunset Cabin and Lakeshore Cottage. Since these are the only two sites in the campground that are waterfront which obviously makes them very hard to get.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The major draw to this area is obviously the lake which is very pretty. There is a swimming area and a boat launch for kayaks/canoes that also has racks to store and lock your boat. Motorboats are not allowed in the lake which make it very nice for paddling around or fishing. There are also several trails around the lake for hiking. It's only 10 minutes away from Saratoga Springs so you have a fun town to go visit while camping as well.</p>
