        <h4>Mohawk Trail State Forest</h4>
        <p>Mohawk Trail State Reservation is located in western Massachusetts about a two hour drive from the Boston area. It’s literally right off Route 2 which makes it convenient and easy to find. Being off Route 2 there are several small towns nearby if you need supplies or want to go to a restaurant. It’s also very close to <a href = "savoy.html">Savoy Mountain State Forest</a> which is about 30 minutes away and a little more remote. We like Mohawk because it’s a relatively short drive for us which makes it great for a quick camping trip. But the tradeoff is that you can both see and hear Route 2 from the campground.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are 56 campsites spread out over three areas and 6 cabins. There are two main loops with most of the sites and then there is another section with sites 17-22 that are tent only and you do have to walk to, the parking for those sites isn’t far. We stayed at site 49 and that’s probably where we should stay again. The sites on this loop are close to the creek but only  half of them have a view/access to it. Most of the sites are fairly close together and the ones that are on the opposite side of the creek are almost completely open. I’d stick with sites 45-50, these give you a little bit more space and privacy. None of the sites have electric/water hookups but there is a dump station located at the campground that has potable water. There are bathrooms located in each camping area but none of them have showers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are lots of rivers and creeks in this area of Massachusetts so if you’re interested in fishing or boating there are plenty of options. The creek that runs through the campground is very shallow, probably less so in the spring/early summer. We were there in August and most of it was between 1-2ft deep. So you’re not going to be fishing, swimming, or boating in it. But it’s still fun to explore and play around in. There are several hiking trails that lead out from the campground, if you take the Indian Lookout Trail be prepared for an extremely steep hike up the mountain.</p>
