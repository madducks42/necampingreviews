        <h4>Mount Greylock Campsite Park Gallery</h4>
        <p>Mount Greylock Campsite Park is a private campground in western Massachusetts. It's located right outside Mount Greylock State Park and is about a two and a half hour drive from the Boston area. The major draw of this area is Mount Greylock, there are a couple small towns nearby but you're basically in the middle of nowhere western Massachusetts.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So far this is the only private campground we've ever stayed at and it was definitely a different experience than staying at state campgrounds. The owners also do most of the managing of the campground and they were the ones who checked us in. They're incredibly nice and informative and seem to really want to make sure everyone has a nice stay. They have a small store on-site and will deliver firewood to your site. All of the trailer/RV sites have electric and water hookups. There are two bathrooms on site, both of which have showers. Depending on where your site is you might have a bit of walk to the restrooms. While there is tent camping available this is definitley catered to the trailer/RV crowd. The area with the pull-thru sites (42-48) felt really crowded. The sites that are farther from that felt a little more secluded but not by much. People were very respectful of quiet hours though so despite the closeness of the sites and openess of the campground, it was quiet and peaceful at night.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even without leaving the campground there is a lot to do. I can see how camping here with young children would be appealing. There is a nice playground on-site as well as a pool. They also have a pond that is stocked with fish, although when we were there the pond was looking a little sad. The water was pretty low and there was a lot of algae. What drew us to this campground was it's proximity to Mount Greylock State Park, this is the closest campground that allows trailers to the park. It's literally a five minute drive to the south entrance of the park.</p>
