        <h4>Little River State Park Gallery</h4>
        <p>Little River State Park is located in Northwestern Vermont, about 15 miles south of Stowe. It’s a three and half drive from the Boston area which makes it a great camping trip for a long weekend. Stowe is a popular town so this area is a little more built up than some of the other areas we visit but it all has that quaint Vermont vibe to it. One thing to keep in mind if you’re planning a fall trip, this area is incredibly popular during late September - October. So you’ll have to book in advance to get a good site. Also be prepared for the nearby towns to be pretty busy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is the largest state campground in Vermont, but it’s still Vermont so it’s not that big. There are either 71 or 81 tent/RV sites, both of those numbers are listed on different places on the website and we didn’t do a count while we were there so can’t confirm the exact number. There are also 20 lean-to sites, and 5 cabins. But despite being Vermont’s largest campground it doesn’t feel crowded. The campground is divided into an “A” and “B” area and the campsites are pretty spread out in those areas. The woods are fairly dense throughout the campground which further increases the privacy you get at your site. None of the campsites are directly on the water but some of them do offer a view of the reservoir. The sites with lean-to’s are also really nice, especially the ones in area “A”. Bathrooms are scattered through the campground so you’re never that far from one. Not all of them have showers though, so depending on your site it might be a bit further walk to the shower If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, there are 27 remote sites available along the shoreline. They’re only accessible by boat and they’re on a first-come, first served basis.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There’s a lot to do in this area. Boating is allowed in the Waterbury Reservoir so you can either bring your own or boat rentals are available. There is a boat launch for campers in area "A". There are a few hiking trail heads that start from the campground and there is a lot more hiking available in the area, this state park is part of the Mt. Mansfield State Forest so there is no shortage of hiking available. You’re also very close to Stowe and Waterbury which means there are lots of great restaurants and breweries in the area. We almost always make a visit to Prohibition Pig in Waterbury. And finally if you have any interest in waterfalls there are quite a few in this area, some of which have some nice swimming holes.</p>
